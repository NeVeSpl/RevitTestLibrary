# RevitTestLibrary (RTL)
Proof of Concept that it is possible to run and debug unit tests in Visual Studio with remote execution inside Revit.

![proof-of-concept](documentation/proof-of-concept.gif)

The first results are very promising, it may someday be ready to be used on production.

## Origin


## Current limitations
 - works only with : Revit 2023 and Visual Studio 2022
 - theoretically it can be used with any test framework, but right now only integration with MSTest v2 is available
 - it is slow and memory hungry
